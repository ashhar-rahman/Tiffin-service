            <p class="aboutus1">
            <h3>How We Started
                Born with a mission to revolutionize eating habits, we believe in providing tiffins in India that are
                healthy, homely and hygienic. These meals are ideal for people who are too busy to cook or donâ€™t wish to
                compromise on nutrition with restaurant food. The menu, at Tifflo, comes in a variety of mouth-watering
                cuisines and nutritional options- a judicious mix of carbohydrates and proteins, low calorie content and
                no artificial flavours/preservatives.

                The team at TIFFILO ensures that the meals are not only healthy but also appealing to the eye and
                palette. We believe in giving surprises and breaking monotony, so our menu changes daily and features.
                That includes a variety of vegetables, daal, soups, raita, rice, rotis, salads, and snack items. These
                are healthy, well-balanced meals, which provide the right amount of protein along with essential
                vitamins and minerals. The same food prepared in canteens or Udupi restaurants can be tasty, but is
                generally oily and big on your pocket.</h3>
